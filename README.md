# SystemDesign
Instead of coding in my local machine, I decided to write new code in github as POC, Which in hindsight, I should have been doing from the veruy begining.
This repo will contain concepts related to System Design and to make thing interesting, I will write the code in the languages I know.
ie. c++, python, Rust and Java
